# 📦 Inventory Management System Using Text Files

Welcome to a beginner-friendly **Python-based Inventory Management System** that uses simple **text files** for storing and managing inventory — no databases, just core programming concepts!

---

## 🧾 Overview

This mini-project is designed to teach and demonstrate file handling using Python. It runs inside a **Jupyter Notebook**, making it interactive and easy to follow. Whether you're a student, beginner, or hobbyist, this project is perfect for getting hands-on experience with:

- Reading and writing text files
- Building logical flows and menus
- Structuring data with basic validation
- Understanding inventory management logic

---

## 📚 Contents

### 🔹 Product Details  
Each product entry consists of:
- **Product ID** – Unique identifier (e.g., `P001`)
- **Product Name** – Descriptive item name (e.g., `Notebook`)
- **Price** – Price per unit (e.g., `25.50`)
- **Quantity** – Units available in inventory

All entries are saved in a structured text format inside `inventory.txt`.

---

### 🔹 Add Products to Inventory  
This section of the code allows users to:
- Input new product data via prompts
- Validate the entries (e.g., non-empty fields, numeric price/quantity)
- Append structured records to `inventory.txt`

It helps users understand how to persist data without using a database.

---

### 🔹 Read Inventory File  
This functionality:
- Reads existing entries from `inventory.txt`
- Parses and displays them in a user-friendly table-like format
- Helps users verify the current inventory and check input accuracy

Additional logic can be added to display total quantities or inventory value.
