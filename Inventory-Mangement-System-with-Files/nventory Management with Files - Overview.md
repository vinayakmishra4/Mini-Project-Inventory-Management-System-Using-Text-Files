# 📦✨ Inventory Management System Using Text Files in Python

Welcome to this simple **Inventory Management System** project! This guide will walk you through building a basic inventory tracker using plain text files and Python — no complex databases required.

## ❓ What is an Inventory Management System?

An **Inventory Management System** is software designed to help businesses track products, stock levels, sales, and transactions. It ensures you always know:

* How many products you have  
* Product prices  
* Total sales  
* Customer details  

This system is crucial for shops and businesses that want to automate and streamline their inventory tracking process.

## 🧩 Key Components of the Inventory System

Each product in the system includes:

| Component         | Description                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Product ID**    | Unique identifier for each product |
| **Product Name**  | Name of the product                |
| **Product Price** | Cost of the product                |
| **Quantity**      | Number of units currently in stock |

You can expand the system by adding more details like manufacturing date, expiry date, and product category.

## 💾 Why Use Text Files?

Instead of databases like MySQL, MongoDB, or even JSON files, this beginner-friendly approach uses simple text files to:

* Learn how data storage works fundamentally  
* Understand how to read, write, and process data  
* Prepare for more advanced systems later  

---

## 🚀 Getting Started: Create Your Inventory File

```python
# Create inventory.txt and add initial products
with open("inventory.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("1, Chocolate, 5, 100\n")
    file.write("2, Milky Bar, 10, 50\n")
    file.write("3, Cake, 300, 5\n")
    file.write("4, Candy, 1, 200\n")
```

Each line represents a product with **Product ID, Name, Price, and Quantity**, separated by commas.

---

## 📖 Reading Inventory Data

```python
with open("inventory.txt", "r") as file:
    data = file.read()

print(data)
```

Output:

```
1, Chocolate, 5, 100
2, Milky Bar, 10, 50
3, Cake, 300, 5
4, Candy, 1, 200
```

---

## 🔢 Counting Unique Products

```python
products = data.splitlines()
unique_products = len(products)
print(f"Total unique products: {unique_products}")
```

Output:

```
Total unique products: 4
```

## ✅ Best Practices When Using Text Files

* **No empty lines:** Avoid extra new lines after the last entry.  
* **Consistent format:** Always use the same format for easy parsing later.  
* **Data validation:** Ensure data types like price and quantity are correct before saving.  

---

## 🏷️ Understanding Product IDs and Barcodes

* **Product ID:** A unique number identifying each product.  
* **Barcodes:** Businesses often use barcodes to scan product IDs quickly.  
* **Efficiency:** Scanning barcodes speeds up sales and inventory updates.  

### Barcode Example

```
| || | || || | | || ||  |
```

Each barcode corresponds to a unique product ID, enabling fast and error-free transactions.

## 🔜 What’s Next?

After mastering this text-file-based system, you can upgrade to:

* Using **CSV** or **JSON** for better data handling  
* Implementing **databases** like SQLite or MongoDB  
* Adding a user interface for easier management  
* Integrating barcode scanning hardware
