## ðŸ“„ Project Description

The **Inventory Management System** is a Python-based application that helps manage and track product stock in a store or warehouse. It is designed using basic **file handling techniques** without the use of a database, making it ideal for small-scale or educational purposes.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives:

- Build a simple inventory management tool.
- Perform CRUD operations on product data.
- Learn and apply file handling in Python.
- Simulate real-world inventory operations using text files.

### ðŸ”§ Key Features:

- **Add New Product**: Input product ID, name, quantity, and price.
- **View Inventory**: Display all stored product details.
- **Search Product**: Locate items using ID or name.
- **Update Product**: Modify quantity or price.
- **Delete Product**: Remove items from inventory.
- **File-Based Storage**: Uses `.txt` or `.csv` file to store data persistently.

### ðŸ’» Technologies Used:

- **Language**: Python
- **Concepts**: File I/O, loops, functions, conditional logic
- **Storage**: Plain text file (`inventory.txt`)

### ðŸš€ Learning Outcomes:

- Strengthen understanding of Python file handling.
- Develop skills in designing menu-driven console apps.
- Simulate basic inventory operations without using databases.

### ðŸ”® Future Enhancements:

- Add user authentication.
- Switch from file to database storage (SQLite, MySQL).
